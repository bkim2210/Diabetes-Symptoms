# Diabetes-Symptoms
Goal
Sylhet Diabetes Hospital would like to see all the patients who came to get tested for diabetes to see whether the result of the test had any correlation with the symptoms the patient's had. With many symptoms playing a factor in the test results, this will help the facility find earlier signs of diabetes.
