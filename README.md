# Diabetes-Symptoms
# Question/Goal
Sylhet Diabetes Hospital would like to see all the patients who came to get tested for diabetes to see whether the result of the test had any correlation with the symptoms the patient's had. With many symptoms playing a factor in the test results, this will help the facility find earlier signs of diabetes.

# Dataset
The dataset we will be using for the our project is the “Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset”. The data was collected by Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The data set contains the patients Age, Gender, Symptoms, and weather the patient was positive or negative for diabetes. T

# Plan/Prepare of the Dataset 
-Abbreviate the column into more simple abbreviation

-Change the “Yes” and “ No” to 1 and 2. 1=Yes and 2=No

-Change “Positive” and Negative to 1 and 2. 1=Yes and 2=No

-Check for NA values and drop the na values if needed or replace them

-Check for outliers and drop the outliers if needed

# Model using in the Dataset

The model will be using to answer our question is a logistic model due to changing the values to 1 and 0 in the columns. This model will help us see which of the symptoms on the dataset had a high correlation with the test results. This will include a confusion matrix and a plot of the ROC curve.
